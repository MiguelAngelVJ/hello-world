Initializing me into the github world.

Hello people!!
We are in entering 2021 still with the Covid-19 pandemic and it seems it won´t go away.
My sister tells me the world is ending. Or at least that we deserve to extinct and leave this world for good. Let´s see what happens in a few years and if the world keeps getting crappier or we manage to escape this global crisis.
